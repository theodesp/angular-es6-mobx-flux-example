# angular-es6-mobx-flux-example

A simple, example app for Angular using es6, mobx and flux.
It uses open Github API to display 
starred repos by users and stargazers by repo

* Webpack reasonable default config.
* ES6, and ES7 support with babel.
* Source maps included in all builds.
* Development server with live reload.
* No gulp and no grunt, just npm scripts.

## Requirements
* node `^4.5.0`
* yarn `^0.17.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

## Install
Install dependencies and check to see it works. 
It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) 
for deterministic installs, but `npm install` will work just as well.

```bash
$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start      # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
```
